      <h1>War is a dessert best served cold!</h1>    
      <p>In the unimaginably distant future, two fledgling empires: the DOGS and the CATS, grapple for control of the Solar System. Their latest target? Jupiter's long-abandoned moons. Why abandoned? Two ancient spacefaring empires, the RATS and the MICE, clashed around Jupiter, each developing a terrifying military infrastructure. Stations acrss nearly every moon, housing devices capable of destroying planets. But then, before these weapons could ever be used, the RATS and the MICE made peace in an unprecedented victory for rodentkind! The moons were abandoned as the RATS and the MICE cavorted amongst the stars. Now, the CATS and the DOGS gaze lustfully upon these weapons of mass destruction. Is it too late for them to come online?</p>
